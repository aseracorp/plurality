# Multi-stage, multi-arch-capable build (linux/amd64, linux/arm64).
#
# Recommended: build each arch natively on its own host and join with
# `docker buildx imagetools create` (this is what .circleci/config.yml does).
# Cross-building a single image with `buildx --platform amd64,arm64` from an
# amd64 host also works but runs the arm64 leg under QEMU, which is ~10x
# slower (the Go compile alone takes ~10 min emulated).
#
# Local single-arch build (native):
#   docker build -t plurality .
#
# Local cross-arch build (slow on non-native legs):
#   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t <tag> --push .
